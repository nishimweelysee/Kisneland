        "content":"From its distinct half-hour time zone to its occasional June snowshower, Newfoundland runs on its own time. By August, the summer crowds have dwindled, berries hang ripe and heavy on their stems, and the landscape is ablaze with wildflowers. Join us at the peak of Newfoundland’s late summer season as we wind our way through the famously Celtic stretch of coastline known as the Irish Loop, exploring its unique history, folklore, cuisine, and breathtaking seaside scenery. We’ll enjoy dinners made from freshly foraged ingredients on a quiet dock, chat with a boat-builder in the midst of making a vessel, and learn how to craft heritage cheese from local experts while surrounded by an adorable, bleating tribe of tiny baby goats. As we make our way along the Loop, we’ll encounter countless characters, places, and stories that give this corner of the island its charm, tenacity, and unique flair. This trip is offered by Atlas Obscura. Once you've reserved your spot, our team will be in touch to help you prepare for the trip. Please note that flights to and from St. John's are not included in the trip cost. This trip is limited by 12 travelers.",
